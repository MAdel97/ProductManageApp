# INTEGRATING LEGACY WEBFORMS WITH MODERN ASP.NET CORE

## MIGRATION PATH OVERVIEW
• Gradual Approach: Migrate page by page rather than all at once
• Shared Authentication: Use identity providers that work with both systems
• API-First Strategy: Build APIs that both systems can consume

## INTEGRATION OPTIONS
• Side-by-Side Deployment: Run both applications with shared authentication
• Iframe Integration: Embed modern pages within legacy WebForms master pages
• Reverse Proxy: Route requests to appropriate application based on URL pattern
• Shared Database: Both systems can access the same data source

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION STEPS
• Step 1: Create shared authentication using Identity Server or similar
• Step 2: Build REST APIs for all data access needs
• Step 3: Implement modern UI components in new ASP.NET Core app
• Step 4: Create URL mapping strategy between old and new pages
• Step 5: Set up shared session state if needed

## COMMON CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS
• Session State: Use distributed cache like Redis
• ViewState: Replace with client-side state management
• Postbacks: Convert to AJAX calls in modern components
• User Controls: Replace with Razor partial views or components
• Master Pages: Use layouts in ASP.NET Core

## TOOLS THAT HELP
• Web.config Transformer: Convert settings to appsettings.json
• Dependency Injection: Replace static classes with services
• Entity Framework Core: Modernize data access layer
• JavaScript Frameworks: Replace WebForms AJAX with modern alternatives

## TESTING STRATEGY
• Create Test Harness: Ensure both systems produce identical results
• API Versioning: Support both old and new clients during transition
• Feature Flags: Enable/disable new features across both systems
• A/B Testing: Compare user experience between old and new pages
